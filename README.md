# surfs_up - Will Oahu be a GREAT location for a SURF SHOP business?

## The Surfs_Up Challenge examined temperature and precipitation to help determine if Oahu will attract surfers to Oahu.

## Method:

### 1) Temperature and precipitation measurements taken (2010-2017).

### 2) 9 stations used to measure temperature and precipitation.

### 3) Summary Statistics taken for temps during months of June & December.

### 4) Added summary statistics for precipitation during months of June & December.



## Analysis and Conclusions:


### 1) Mean temp for June is 4 degs warmer than mean temp for December.

### 2) December mean prcp is 50% higher than June mean prcp.

### 3) June is warmer with less prcp than December.

### 4) Wind Speed statistics SHOULD have been included in this study.

### 5) Great surfing requires Great WAVES!

### 6) Mean wind speed would be a good predictor of Wave Size?

### 7) Statistics for temp, prcp, & wind speed needed for EVERY month!
